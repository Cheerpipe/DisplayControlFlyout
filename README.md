Boried of the Windows 11 display mode selector flyout because it don't support special modes with more than two displays. I was also tired of the amount of clicks required for  changen HDR settings so added a quick toggle for this.

Take into account that this application was coded for my own setup because there is no an API (or easy way) to know what display config is currently active with more than two displays.
